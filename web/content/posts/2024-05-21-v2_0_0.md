Over the past few months, I have been able to significantly improve the way that icons are built, generated and shared within IKONO. This has involved a large number of architectural changes to allow us to grow without hitting roadblocks.

---

## What's changed?

Whilst as a whole the interface looks the same (with some minor improvements to interactions and transitions), under the hood there has been a big change to how icon variants are stored and generated. This gives us the ability to support variants of different **sizes** and **variants**.

### Improved consistency

When I started designing the icons, I added to the library when the need for a new icon came up and often designed them in isolation. This let to a large library of inconsistent sizing, borders and styling.

In version 2.0.0, all icons have painstakingly updated to fit with new IKONO icon style guidelines:

- Stroke width should be `1.5px`.
- Standard icons should have a container of `24x24` with mini fitting into `20x20`.
- Icons should fit roughly within set template boundaries for each size.
- Lines should have a round endcap - limited exceptions may apply.

Applying these rules ensures that all icons can be paired together and look consistent throughout your interfaces.

### Custom set of **mini** icons

As previously discussed, improving consistency was a important part of to this release. Before, mini icons were generated during build and were based on the standard icons. As a result, full control over the look and feel of the mini icons was lost, as well as any form of line width consistency.

This meant there was no option but to spend the time manually rescaling and updating all of the standard icons to build a full pack of custom mini icons.

### Improvements to the UI

One of the main factors that let me to build an interface for IKONO and share it for free was to make it as easy as possible to go from needing an icon to having one built into your app. This meant the interface had to be as seamless as possible.

Currently, there are a number of ways of getting an icon from IKONO:

- Copying the SVG or JSX directly via one of the clickable buttons in the interface.
- Exporting the icon as a PNG.
- Using the [React library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ikono/react).
- Using the [Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1230547475211377845/ikono-icons).
